# CF-peaks-detection
These scripts allow for scanning images along a grid of 100 lines (50 vertical and 50 horizontal) and for analysing the profile of intensity along each line. This allows for the detection, along the profiles of intensity, of:
- peaks and valleys location
- peaks and valleys intensities
- peaks relative intensity above the valleys intensity
- peaks width
- peaks slope

These analysis is divided in two parts:
-PART1, a Fiji macro
-PART2, an R script

These tools have been developed for analysis of one-channel and one-slice fluorescence microscopy images, to quantify the spread of CF from the vasculature in leaves.
